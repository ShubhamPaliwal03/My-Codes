    <h1>Mountains</h1>
    <p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres above the surrounding land.</p>
    <h2>Types of Mountains :</h2>
    <p>There are five main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, plateau, fault-block and dome.</p>
