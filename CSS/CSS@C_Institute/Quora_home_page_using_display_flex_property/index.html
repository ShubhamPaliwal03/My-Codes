                        I feel I am uniquely qualified to answer this question!
                        It was 1986, and I was working at AT&T Bell Labs. Our department was only the second in the entire company that was using this compiler called cfront for a new language called C++. I knew the C language, and was in the process of learning C++ along with others in my group. One day, I was puzzled by a certain construct in the C++ language.
                        Now, Stroustrup was also an employee at AT&T Bell Labs. His name and number was listed in the company directory. (Because he was in a different location, I had to dial him using the “8” prefix, if I recall correctly, followed by the location code.)
                        I called him, and he picked up. I posed my question to him and told him that I had already consulted his C++ book. Without any delay whatsoever, and I mean instantly, he told me to “turn to page X” (I honestly don’t remember the page # after so many years, but it was a very specific topic deep in the book, say on page 197). And I remember that I did not hear any sound of him picking up his book, going through the pages; really, no time elapsed for any of that. It was more akin to a Jennings-level Jeopardy! contestant already providing an answer while the question is still in the process of being asked.
                        Sure enough, my question had a clear answer on that very page! I was just amazed how he knew the page # by heart! I thanked him and hung up. I thought to myself, no wonder he came up with the language, and wrote the cfront preprocessor all by himself!
                        I am mad at myself for not getting the book autographed during those days.
