            /* It is highly not recommended to use the order property to order the elements, because it only changes the order of the 
               elements visually through css rules, and does not actually change the order of the elements in DOM.

                And, as we know that there are many such cases where using this can cause havocs in the code, 

                Eg. => 
                
                1. In case of Form Elements, the flow of focus follows the order as specified in the DOM, and not the visual order, hence
                   it can create major ui issues in the code.

                2. In case of Screen Readers, they also follow the DOM order and not the visual order.

                Hence, it is to be used only in the worst-case scenarios, where you cannot touch the HTML DOM, and yet have to change the order visually.
