When to use top and when to use margin-top :
------------------------------------------

when making an element relative, you are supposed to use top. why:

margin-top has to do with the element’s box model. it adds to its box model height.
top has to do with its position, the offset. the offset leaves the box model’s height at the same value.
that says top and margin-top are not the same.

so: top is the same box, but moved, margin-top is a “taller” box. by position:relative you declare your intention to move the box, not change it to a bigger one. so top it is.

on the side note: position:relative has two effects:

the element will still occupy its box model space at the position where he was previously before being moved using top, left.
it will appear “floated” to the new position, that is, w/o taking space, like being taken out of the normal flow at its new position.
using only margin-top on a position:relative element will only “move” the content inside it, the element will be found at the same offset.
